nplab tests
=====
These tests are designed to be run from pytest, so CD to the project directory and run "py.test" at the command line.  That should auto-find the tests directory, and test all the units that can be automatically tested.  You may need to install pytest, though it's included in Anaconda.  See the pytest documentation for more information on how to write unit tests - and do include test code for everything you can!
